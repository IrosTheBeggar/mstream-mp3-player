**{{VERSION}} is a {{CHANNEL}}.** It works on the hardware below, and things
may still change between versions, including what it saves on the device.
Bug reports are welcome in the [issues]({{REPO_URL}}/issues): please
include the Version row from **Output > About** (it reads {{VERSION}},
ELF {{ELF}} for this build).

Source for this binary: {{SOURCE_URL}}, and with its libraries in
`{{SOURCE_TAR}}` below.

## Hardware

- **Tested:** M5Stack Core2 **v1.3** (AXP192 power chip).
- **Untested** (it should work; reports welcome, with a photo of Output >
  About): the original Core2 (v1.0), the Core2 for AWS, and the Core2
  v1.1 (AXP2101 power chip).
- Other M5Stack devices (Basic, Fire, Tough, CoreS3) are not supported.

## Install

{{INSTALL_LINE}}

Or with [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/)
(`pip install esptool`; add `-p PORT` if it doesn't find the Core2):

- **First install** over other firmware (M5Stack's demo, UIFlow): erase
  first, which also clears what that firmware left behind.

  ```
  esptool --chip esp32 erase-flash
  esptool --chip esp32 -b 921600 write-flash 0x0 {{FULL_BIN}}
  ```

- **Update** (keeps the settings, the paired headphones, the touch
  calibration and where you were): the same file, without erasing.

  ```
  esptool --chip esp32 -b 921600 write-flash 0x0 {{FULL_BIN}}
  ```

The settings sit above everything the image writes, so an update never
touches them.

**No port shows up?** Use a USB-C cable that carries data (some only
charge), and install the USB serial driver: a Core2 has a CH9102 or a
CP2104 chip, depending on when it was made. Both drivers are under "USB
Driver" at [docs.m5stack.com/en/download](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/download);
if unsure, install both. On Linux, add yourself to the `dialout` group.

## The microSD card

- Format it **FAT32** (MBR). exFAT cards, which is how most cards of 64 GB
  and up come, don't mount: the player says there's no card. Windows only
  offers FAT32 up to 32 GB; for a bigger card use a FAT32 formatting tool.
- Put the music under **`/music`**, e.g. `/music/Artist/Album/01 - Title.mp3`.
  An album's cover is the `cover.jpg` (or `folder.jpg`) next to its tracks.
- Pair headphones from **Output > Pair new headphones**. The player never
  pairs with anything by itself.

## Known limits

- MP3 and FLAC only.
- Over Bluetooth only 44.1 kHz files play (most music); a file at another
  rate (48 kHz) is skipped with a message.
- Text is drawn in Latin scripts only.
- Progressive JPEG covers aren't shown (the album shows a note instead).
- The first queue is the whole library followed by nine built-in test
  tones and click tracks.
- No WiFi yet: syncing with an mStream server comes later.
